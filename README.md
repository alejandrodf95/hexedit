2. Open `hexedit.py` and specify the name of the `.exe` file in the `FILE_NAME` variable.

   ```python
   FILE_NAME = "your_file_name.exe"

3. To run the script, open a terminal or command line and navigate to the directory where the files are located. Then execute the following command:

## Notes

- **Ensure you have the necessary permissions** to modify the `.exe` file.
- **Make a backup of the `.exe` file** before modifying it to avoid any potential data loss.
- If you have any questions or encounter any issues, **feel free to open an issue** in the repository or **contact the script's author**.
- In the **Releases** section, you will find versions of the script that have been converted into executable files. These versions are designed to modify specific values in certain `.exe` files for particular purposes.
